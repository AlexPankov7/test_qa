Brief instructions for working with GIT.
_______________________________________
____________________________________


1.Create a repository on github
2. Clone it with SSH key or HTTPS
3.Go to the folder where you want to clone the project (command cd)
4. To clone, enter the git clone command and then SSH key (namely, the public key !!!)
   (Command to insert into git bush - SHIFT + INSERT)

Next, git bush will ask permission to connect to the github.com host. Enter yes
Next, you will be asked for a password. We enter it.

We can make sure that the tast_qa directory has been created, and if we go into it (cd test_qa), we will see the master or main flag.

And to make sure that this is github and not some other hosting, enter the command
git remote -v


The next thing to do is create a file and put the information in that file.
1.Create a file (this is the song.txt file) and make changes in it.
2. We return to the git bush and call the git status command. After that, git will tell us that a new song.txt file has appeared in the current folder and offer to add it to the commit (add .)
3. Add the file to the commit with the command git add song.txt
4. We call git status again and we see that song.txt is highlighted in green.
5.Make a commit directly git commit -m "here we write the name of our commit"
6. The git log command will show the commit history.
7. And it remains only to synchronize your local repository with the remote one (upload all changes to github) git push command
